    <h1>Dear Aneto Hiring Team,</h1>

    <p>
      I saw your posting for a Junior Developer and didn’t even blink, this is exactly the kind of opportunity I’ve been grinding for.
      Aneto’s focus on AI-powered infrastructure caught my eye immediately, and I knew I had to shoot my shot.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a full-stack developer with hands-on experience building modern applications using Node.js, MySQL, and React.
      Most of what I know, I learned the hard way through personal projects, remote contracts, and debugging messes I inherited.
      That’s how I know I’m ready to jump into a real team and bring value from day one.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m no stranger to RESTful APIs, full lifecycle builds, and collaboration in async environments.
      I'm currently remote, but always plugged in and proactive. I document my code, commit like clockwork, and communicate clearly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’d love to help Aneto build apps that actually matter. Let’s build something sharp, scalable, and maybe even a little dangerous.
    </p>
